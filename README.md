This repository contains the code for the Master's Thesis written by Francesco Freni under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Jonas Peters at ETH Zurich during Spring 2025.


## ðŸš€ Installation

The code is organized as a Python package, and can be installed using `pip`:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:francescofreni/nldg.git
cd nldg
pip install -e .
```
To install it in editable mode (for modifying the code and seeing the changes immediately) and with developer dependencies (for testing and code formatting), replace the last line with:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```


## ðŸ”§ Usage
The code in **notebooks/demo.ipynb** demonstrates the core functionality of the main functions provided in this repository.


## ðŸ§ª Running experiments

Running the experiments is as simple as:
```bash
python experiments/name_experiments_file.py
```


## ðŸš¨ Tests

The code base comes with a set of unit tests, which can be run using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest tests
```


## ðŸ“š Documentation

As of now, the code does not have explicit documentation, but the code is heavily commented and should be easy to understand. 
The code is also automatically formatted using `black`, linted with `ruff`, and type-checked with `mypy`.
